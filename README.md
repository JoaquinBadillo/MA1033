# MA1033: Analysis of Differential Equations

Project for Tec de Monterrey's B.S. in Computer Science and Technology course Analysis of Differential Equations. The purpose of this project is to model a bungee jump using differential equations. It was expected to determine the parameters and initial conditions from data and solve the differential equation for this particular system, however I found it more valuable to solve the differential equation for a general system and create a computer program to get plots for any desired set of paramaters.
